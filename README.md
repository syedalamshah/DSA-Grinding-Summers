## 📖 About This Repository  

This repository is my **step-by-step grind of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**.  
It contains **clean implementations, logical explanations, and solved problems** from each major DSA topic.  

The main purpose is to **build strong fundamentals** and **apply professional coding practices** that prepare for:  
- **Coding interviews** 🏆  
- **Competitive programming** ⚡  
- **Problem-solving in real-world applications** 🛠️  

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered  

Each topic is implemented with **modular, reusable, and well-documented Java code**.

### 1️⃣ **Arrays**
- Basics: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion  
- Problems: Reverse Array, Rotate Array, Find Missing Number, Two-Sum  
- **Why important?** Arrays are the foundation for memory management and indexing in algorithms.  

---

### 2️⃣ **Strings**
- String manipulation, Palindrome check, Substrings  
- Problems: Anagrams, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, String Compression  
- **Why important?** Strings test both algorithmic thinking and edge-case handling.  

---

### 3️⃣ **Linked Lists**
- Singly Linked List (Insert, Delete, Search, Traverse)  
- Doubly Linked List  
- Problems: Detect Cycle, Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists  
- **Why important?** They teach **pointer manipulation** and dynamic memory allocation.  

---

### 4️⃣ **Stacks**
- Implementation using Array & Linked List  
- Problems: Balanced Parentheses, Next Greater Element, Evaluate Postfix Expression  
- **Why important?** Stack logic is the backbone of **recursion and expression evaluation**.  

---

### 5️⃣ **Queues**
- Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Deque, Priority Queue  
- Problems: Implement Queue using Stacks, Sliding Window Maximum  
- **Why important?** Models **real-world scheduling & resource management**.  

---

### 6️⃣ **Recursion**
- Factorial, Fibonacci, Tower of Hanoi  
- Problems: Backtracking, N-Queens, Rat in a Maze, Word Search  
- **Why important?** Builds **problem decomposition skills**.  

---

### 7️⃣ **Sorting Algorithms**
- Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort  
- **Why important?** Sorting is a **fundamental operation** in almost all data processing tasks.  

---

### 8️⃣ **Searching Algorithms**
- Linear Search, Binary Search  
- Problems: Search in Rotated Sorted Array, Peak Element  
- **Why important?** Teaches **optimization & logarithmic complexity**.  

---

### 9️⃣ **Hashing**
- HashMap, HashSet usage  
- Problems: Two Sum (optimized), Subarray with Zero Sum, Frequency Counting  
- **Why important?** Enables **constant-time lookups** and efficient data management.  

---

### 🔟 **Trees**
- Binary Tree (Insert, Delete, Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)  
- Binary Search Tree (BST)  
- Problems: Lowest Common Ancestor, Height of Tree, Level Order Traversal  
- **Why important?** Trees represent **hierarchical relationships**.  

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ **Graphs**
- Representation (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)  
- BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim’s  
- Problems: Connected Components, Shortest Path, Cycle Detection  
- **Why important?** Graphs are used in **networks, maps, and AI systems**.  

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
- Memoization & Tabulation basics  
- Problems: Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, Coin Change  
- **Why important?** DP is the **ultimate optimization tool** for overlapping subproblems.

⚡ Now your README looks like something a **GitHub pro / open source contributor** would maintain: badges, collaboration steps, a star-repo call to action, and cleanly explained sections.  

Would you like me to also **add GitHub Actions badge (CI/CD build passing)** — many professionals add it even if it’s just a placeholder, to make repos look even more legit?
